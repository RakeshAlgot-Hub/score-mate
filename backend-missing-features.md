# Missing Backend Features for Complete Cricket Scoring System

Based on the existing backend structure and the frontend requirements, here are the missing features that need to be implemented:

## üö® Critical Missing Features

### 1. **Undo Last Ball Endpoint**
```python
@router.post("/matches/{matchId}/undo")
async def undoLastBall(matchId: str):
    """
    Remove the last ball from the match and recalculate scoreboard
    """
    # Implementation needed:
    # 1. Find and delete the last ball from balls collection
    # 2. Recalculate scoreboard from remaining balls
    # 3. Update scoreboard collection
    # 4. Return updated scoreboard
```

### 2. **Ball History in Scoreboard**
The `ballHistory` field exists in the Scoreboard model but needs to be populated with recent balls (last 10-20 balls) for frontend display.

### 3. **Over Completion Detection**
Backend needs to track when 6 legal balls are completed and handle:
- Strike rotation
- Bowler change prompts
- Maiden over detection

### 4. **Innings Transition Logic**
```python
# Missing logic for:
# - Detecting when innings is complete (all out, overs finished, target achieved)
# - Setting up 2nd innings with target
# - Switching batting/bowling teams
# - Match completion detection
```

### 5. **Real-time Scoreboard Calculations**
Ensure all these are calculated correctly after each ball:
- Strike rates for batsmen
- Economy rates for bowlers  
- Current run rate
- Required run rate (2nd innings)
- Fall of wickets tracking

## üîß **Implementation Requirements**

### Ball Processing Logic
```python
async def process_ball(match_id: str, ball_data: BallEvent):
    # 1. Validate ball data
    # 2. Update match state (current batsmen, bowler)
    # 3. Calculate runs, wickets, extras
    # 4. Handle strike rotation for odd runs
    # 5. Check for over completion
    # 6. Update all player statistics
    # 7. Save ball to collection
    # 8. Recalculate and update scoreboard
    # 9. Check for innings/match completion
```

### Scoreboard Recalculation
```python
async def recalculate_scoreboard(match_id: str):
    """
    Recalculate entire scoreboard from all balls in the match
    Used for undo functionality and data consistency
    """
    # 1. Get all balls for the match
    # 2. Process each ball sequentially
    # 3. Calculate all statistics
    # 4. Update scoreboard collection
```

### Over Management
```python
def is_over_complete(current_balls: int, ball_type: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if over is complete (6 legal balls)
    Wide and no-ball don't count toward over completion
    """
    
def handle_over_completion(scoreboard: dict):
    """
    Handle end of over:
    - Switch strike between batsmen
    - Check for maiden over
    - Reset over-specific counters
    """
```

## üìä **Data Structure Enhancements**

### Enhanced Ball Collection
```python
# Add these fields to ball collection:
{
    "isLegalBall": bool,  # false for wides, no-balls
    "ballSequence": int,  # Global sequence including extras
    "overNumber": int,    # Which over this ball belongs to
    "ballInOver": int,    # Position in over (1-6 for legal balls)
}
```

### Scoreboard Enhancements
```python
# Ensure these are properly calculated:
{
    "currentRunRate": float,      # Current scoring rate
    "requiredRunRate": float,     # Required rate for 2nd innings
    "ballsRemaining": int,        # Balls left in innings
    "runRate": float,            # Overall run rate
    "projectedScore": int,       # Projected final score
}
```

## üéØ **Business Logic Requirements**

### 1. **Strike Rotation Logic**
- After odd runs (1, 3, 5), batsmen should switch
- After even runs (0, 2, 4, 6), striker remains same
- After wicket, new batsman comes to striker's end

### 2. **Extras Handling**
- Wide ball: Add runs + reball (if settings allow)
- No ball: Add runs + reball (if settings allow)  
- Bye/Leg bye: Add runs, no reball
- All extras add to team total but not batsman's score

### 3. **Wicket Processing**
- Update batsman as out with dismissal type
- Bring new batsman to striker's end
- Update fall of wickets
- Check if innings is complete (10 wickets)

### 4. **Match State Management**
```python
# Track these states properly:
- Current striker/non-striker
- Current bowler
- Balls bowled in current over
- Legal balls vs total balls
- Innings completion status
- Match completion status
```

## üöÄ **API Response Standardization**

### Consistent Response Format
```python
# All endpoints should return:
{
    "success": bool,
    "message": str,
    "data": any,
    "timestamp": str
}
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Proper error responses for:
- Invalid match ID
- Match already completed  
- Invalid ball data
- Player not found
- Database errors
```

## üìà **Performance Optimizations**

### Database Indexes
```javascript
// Add these indexes:
db.balls.createIndex({"matchId": 1, "timestamp": -1})
db.balls.createIndex({"matchId": 1, "innings": 1, "over": 1})
db.scoreboards.createIndex({"matchId": 1})
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache current scoreboard in memory
- Update cache after each ball
- Invalidate cache on undo operations

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**

### Unit Tests Needed
- Ball processing logic
- Over completion detection
- Innings transition
- Scoreboard calculations
- Undo functionality

### Integration Tests
- Complete match flow
- Multiple innings handling
- Error scenarios
- Concurrent ball submissions

## üìù **Documentation Updates**

### API Documentation
- Complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Request/response examples
- Error code definitions
- Rate limiting information

### Business Logic Documentation
- Cricket scoring rules implementation
- Edge case handling
- State transition diagrams
- Calculation formulas
